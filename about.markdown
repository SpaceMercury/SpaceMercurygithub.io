Hi! I'm Pol Fuentes, a master's student in Cybersecurity at EPFL and ETH Zürich. My academic journey has fueled my passion for the intersection of AI, machine learning, cybersecurity, and networks. I thrive on tackling challenging problems and am always eager to learn and innovate.

Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy skiing, biking, and playing music—creativity and exploration are at the core of who I am. Photography is another passion of mine, and I plan to add a dedicated section to this site to showcase some of my work.

I built this site to provide a space where you can learn more about me and my work. It’s also a convenient place to access my CV and keep track of my latest projects. Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect!
